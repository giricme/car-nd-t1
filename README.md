# Udacity Self Driving Cars Nanodegree - Term 1

This repository contains the project output from my Udacity Self Driving Cars Nanodegree - Term 1.

* CarND-LaneLines-P1 - In this project you will detect lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV. 
* CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines - In this project, we write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
* CarND-Traffic-Signs - In this project, we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. 
* CarND-Behavioral-Cloning - The goal of this project is to train a car to steer around a track. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map images from front-facing cameras directly to steering angles. 
* CarND-Vehicle-Detection - In this project, we write a software pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
